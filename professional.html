                        <h3> 2021-Present </h3>
                        <p>I am currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at <a
                                href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a>.
                            I work with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">Maxine</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">Broadcast</a>
                            products. For the algorithms and features in the products, I work on
                            AI-based video-enhancement features such as webcam-denoising, artifact-reduction and,
                            generative AI-based image animation such as eye-contact and live-portrait models.
                        </p>

                        <p>I also focus on bringing these models to production using NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) and
                            NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs).
                            In doing so, I have also built and release AI Foundation models, complete with Model Card++.
                            NVCF endpoints are cloud-based inference endpoints that are supported by Triton Inference
                            Servers.
                        </p>

                        <p>I also focus on efficient enterprise-level ML platforms within NVIDIA, with a particular
                            focus on
                            MLops for computer vision teams. I worked with multiple-teams and architected cross-cutting
                            infrastructure tools
                            for data governance, management, visualization and preparation. I also built and migrated
                            workloads for training
                            and benchmarking of various computer vision models including architecting systems for
                            logging, visualization, KPI tracking,
                            continual training, hyper-parameter optimization artifact and configuration management etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>For obvious reasons, some of the work that was performed while being employed by NVIDIA will
                            not be made public here.

                        <p>I was employed as an Applied Scientist at Amazon <a
                                href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa">Alexa
                                AI</a>.
                            My focus was on efficient enterprise-level ML platforms that powered Alexaâ€™s
                            model-training
                            infrastructure,
                            used by over 1500 scientists with hundreds of models trained everyday. I primarily
                            focused
                            on cost-efficient,
                            and scalable distributed training environments. I worked both in engineering and
                            research
                            capacities. The problem
                            spaces that I focused on were neural network compression via network architecture search
                            and
                            predictive
                            early-stopping algorithms. Some of
                            the work I have done in this team have been featured at EMNLP 2020.</p>

                        <p>Previously, I was an applied scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web
                                Services </a> AI Labs.
                            I was part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">AWS
                                SageMaker</a> launch team and was
                            involved in the development of several AWS Sagemaker CV algorithms, with primary
                            ownership
                            stake in Object
                            Detection and Semantic Segmentation algorithms. I also was a member of the launch team
                            of
                            Sagemaker RL.
                            I owned and launched model compression using RL that became a significant part of the
                            Keynote address at
                            re:Invent 2019. I also worked on domain-adaptation algorithms for Sagemaker CV, which
                            lead
                            to both products
                            and publications including an oral paper at CVPR 2019.</p>
