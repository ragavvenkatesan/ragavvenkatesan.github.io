<p>I know I have mentioned this movie in so many places previously, but now I realize that everytime I watch that movie, I find a different meaning to it all together. Each character was defined perfectly and portrayed effectively by all the actors. Each character has a well-thought out back story and there are no loop holes one could find. The entire movie consists of RR composed using just the three chords, C Minor, Bb Major  and G# Major. Chinmayi has done an awesome job as voice for Tanishka. Her voice literally is the one bringing the character alive. Yes, guys and girls do contradict a lot. The Ying Yang symbol in the movie title shows clearly, the fact that both, though both the male and female contradict each other, they both land up intertwined. A fact that is common in any successful relationship.</p>
