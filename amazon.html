                            <p>I am currently employed as an Applied Scientist at Amazon <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa">Alexa AI</a>.
                               My current focus is on efficient enterprise-level ML platforms that power Alexaâ€™s model-training infrastructure, 
                               used by over 1500 scientists with hundreds of models trained everyday. I primarily focus on cost-efficient, 
                               and scalable distributed training environments. I work both in engineering and research capacities. The problem 
                               spaces that I currently focus on are neural network compression and predictive early-stopping algorithms. Some of 
                               the work I have done in this team have been featured at EMNLP 2020.</p>

                                <p>Previously, I was an applied scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services </a> AI Labs. 
                                I was part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">AWS SageMaker</a> launch team and was 
                                involved in the development of several AWS Sagemaker CV algorithms, with primary ownership stake in Object 
                                Detection and Semantic Segmentation algorithms. I also was a member of the launch team of Sagemaker RL. 
                                I owned and launched model compression using RL that became a significant part of the Keynote address at 
                                re:Invent 2019. I also worked on domain-adaptation algorithms for Sagemaker CV, which lead to both products 
                                and publications including an oral paper at CVPR 2019.</p>

                                 <p>For obvious reasons, some of the work that was performed while being employed by Amazon will not be made public here. 
                                Others that are already launched or made public are listed here.</p>
