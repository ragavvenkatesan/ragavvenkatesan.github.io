<p>Ganesh was wondering what this man was doing here in the middle of nowhere. Never in his life had he seen a man so divine, yet so scary at the same time. The man is barely clothed and the days are getting colder down here in the earth. He already missed the cozyness of his air-conditioned apartment in the sky. He hated the land. He was wondering if he should offer him his coat.</p>

<p>Just then the man signaled Ganesh to follow. They walked in silence till they reached a settlement by the banks of the river. Ganesh knew that Saraswati flows through this region, though he had never seen her in here. The revered man sat down by the foot of a tree, Ganesh followed him.</p>

<p>"Wondering why I am living here alone and away from the bustle?", asked the man. Ganesh answered,"Wondering if I could learn how to muster the cold". Somehow that seemed to be the most intriguing thing about this man. He is unfazed by the hardships of the dying world.</p>

<p>"The reason I called you here Ganesh, is that I wanted to make the greatest scientific achievements of this yuga accessible to the people of the kali yuga. You do realize that they are going to be dull and would need a lot of help to develop into intellectual beings don't you ? We wouldn't want mankind to go the way of the chimps", said the man.</p>

<p>Ganesha said,"My father always says that Sage Vyasa is the wisest of all. If you say so, it is indeed true sir. What I don't understand though is that why can't the people of kalki realize what we have achieved? They will be, by no means, weaker than us". Vyasa simply replied," Their progress will be overcome by greed and their potential, hampered by corruption".</p>

<p>Ganesh was curious. He had learnt from his father, that Kalki was final the avatar of vishnu. Vishnu, the life. It is the reason for everything artificial in existance. Isn't the deshavatar representative of the evolution of life itself. Significant multi-cellular life started as fish, thus the matsyam, it evolved into amphibians, thus the koormam and so on, it finally lead to Rama and Krishna, the fully evolved scientifically and culturally advanced men. Kalki is the next stage. Kalki is where man performs acts beyond possibility and achieve impossible feats. He always thought that Kalki would be the golden era of mankind.</p>

<p>Vyasa suddenly interrupted this chain of thought. He said,"I know exactly what you are thinking my son. Everyone, including your father think that Kalki is going to be the golden age of mankind. Alas, how very wrong they are. Kalki is rather the dark age of human era. Man will kill fellow man for entertainment. Wars will be launched for the propagation of religion. Harmony will exist only in music, and that barely. Of course he will do great things,but we are not doing the same things. For they are great, yet terrible."</p>

<p>Ganesh said," The earth barely sustains the wars in this time sir, what with all the radioactive weapons being used. Won't that mean the end for the planet, if man could potentially become more lethal?". He was wondering how much powerful man can get.</p>

<p>Vyasa replied," At the cost of being heavy-headed son, they are never going to be as powerful as we are now. The farthest that their machines will ever travel to is just beyond the reach of the sun. Their space stations will be hopelessly pathetic compared to our space cities. Their cities will be made of huts when you compare it with the fine architecture of Pataliputra and Dwaraka. Their vimanas are mere insects. They won't realize how weak and dumb they are compared to the dwapara man. It is their superiority complex which is hamper them. They will think that they are the greatest the planet has ever seen. Each generation will gloat to the previous that they are the epitome of science and technology. All the while not realizing that we lived the real golden age. Some of our temples and rituals will not be considered as schools of science and art, but rather as mere superstition and will ridiculed. Why in fact the Vedas, Upanishads, Dhivya Prabhandham and Sangam literature that are going to be penned down by the wise people of this era will be considered myth and not as scientific proceedings of this era. Man will be so naive and careless with his ancestral heritage that he will go back to being nomads and start all over again, only because he disregards our knowledge."</p>

<p>Ganesh listened intently to all this. He still had one nagging question unanswered. He was wondering if he dared ask this to Vyasa. He figured he should give it a shot. He asked,"So what will happen to us." Vyasa simply replied,"Dwapara yuga is about to end, you know that".</p>

<p>Ganesh can now see the full scene unfold. The end of dwapara yuga is already here. Kurukshetra just happened and witnessed the change in man. The greatest war that had even been and will ever be fought. A war with such intensity and power, that the Nuclear wars of the future will just be mockery. Mankind is coming to an end. He asked Vyasa," How long ?"</p>

<p>Vyasa pondered over question. "I give it a maximum of 4000 years. The rest of kalki will just be the dying lifeless planet.",he replied. Shock went over Ganesh. 4000 years is a very small time. It can hardly be considered a yuga. The man of kalki must be so reckless if he is going to destroy himself completely within such a short time. He was secretly glad that he is not going to live the kalki world in earth. He will be safe in Kailash, with his family</p>

<p>"Now lets get down to business Ganesh. We have a lot of work to do. Writing the story of Kirshna is not a simple undertaking, considering we should write in a form that is easily understood by the naive men of Kalki.", said Vyasa. Ganesh knew ofcourse that it is hopeless to write this epic, he just wondered whether there will be any man in the kali yuga, who would knew what the men of dwapara yuga achieved. He prayed the apocalypse that is going to transition dwapara yuga into the kali yuga be quick and Krishna's demise would be fast. He took his pen, and got ready to be the scribe, for the greatest story ever recited.</p>
