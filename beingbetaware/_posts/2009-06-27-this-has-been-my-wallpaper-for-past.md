<p>This has been my wallpaper for the past month. Ever since M.J. said he is going to perform on 
stage again on his comeback tour, to start at london in july. The tour in which he promised he 
will do everything the fans wanted. It's a real pity that with 50 sold out concerts in pipeline,
 that the gods be so cruel as to take him now. </p>

<p>I have been a fan of the king of pop ever since i was in kinder garten. I used to dance like him,
 I used to dress like him, there were times in which every thing that i did will have something 
 resembling him. He was a big personality from where I grew up. Every show that I did used to be 
 successful because every show I did then will have something to do with M.J. For some one like me,
 he is an inspiration, a real motivation, like the north star - always guiding us along. With no 
 teacher to learn but the will to dance, there are so many of us who proudly call ourselves 
 <i>MJ impersonators</i>, and performed in a style which we ourselves christined as 
 <i>MJ impersonation</i>. Everytime we go on stage wearing the Billie Jean costumes on, we would 
  feel alive. Alive like we have never felt before, even when we are sick or tired, we would get 
  energy when we put on the glove and the hat .</p>

<p>There has never been a time when i haven't recieved laudation when i am on stage and doing
 the moonwalk or the breaks. Such were the popularity of his moves that everyone feels proud if they
  are able to do them. The day he passed away is clearly the day that a part of music and dance 
  died. We can never see the moonwalk on stage again. We can never see Billie Jean being performed 
  live. The world is left with a void that no one else can ever replace. He has done so many things 
  in the industry that whatever anyone else tries, it will just be an attempt to recreate what MJ 
  has already done before. Every choreography thats is done in every music video or every dance 
  reality show on TV, has got some or the other influence from him. Has there been a better lyricist
  than him whose words touch us and move us.</p> 
  
<p>Today as he passes away, we MJ impersonators feel like a part of us died with him, yet a part of 
him will remain with us forever. With 13 grammys, 8 on one award ceremony, 750 million copies of his
 music sold, holding records in the guiness book of world records, being the first ever black 
 performer to hit the MTV screens, being one of the most popular entertainer in history, being the 
 perfect ambassador of charity, he is a loss to the human race, an inspiration when he lived, a 
 legend as he passes away, we are the legacy he left behind. His name will resonate in the history 
 books for ever and ever to come . May his soul rest in peace .</p>
