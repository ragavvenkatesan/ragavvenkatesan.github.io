                        <p>My current research interests in computer vision and machine learning are in deeper
                            understanding of
                            discriminative <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yann.network">convolutional neural
                                networks</a> and their feature representations.
                            Particularly, I am interested in the compression of convolutional neural networks.
                            I am also highly interested in several application areas therein such as domain adaptation,
                            task transfer and medical image
                            lesion detection and identification.</p>

                        <p>My doctoral dissertation involved work in <a target="_blank"
                                href="{{ site.url }}/projects/mil.html">multiple instance learning</a>,
                            in designing statistical learning algorithms and image feature design.
                            In particular I was interested in developing assistive technologies for
                            ophthalmological-clinical purposes.</p>

                        <p>I was also involved in an intelligent transport system development project called the MIDAS
                            project,
                            where my research included detection algorithms for detection of lanes, lane-markers,
                            prediction of lanes,
                            self-positioning of vehicles on-road, detection of cars, sign boards, anomalies and
                            situational awareness.
                            The project involved building of smart car networks towards reduced road congestion.
                            It used several Bayesian modelling systems to achieve the same. I was also involved in a
                            similar
                            research effort vehicle detection at Intel as a co-op for 8 months. That work involved
                            methods
                            similar to deformable part models and regionlets.</p>

                        <p>My masters research was directed towards image/video interpolation, where I worked on video
                            de-interlacing using control-grid interpolation. My research included visual-saliency
                            detection
                            and quaternion mathematics for images.</p>
