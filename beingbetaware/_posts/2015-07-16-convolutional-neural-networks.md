<p>There has been quite a lot of press attention because of these kind of images (Deep dream: produces such rich hallucinations such as the above image). 
    I started reading CNN literature somewhere around January 2015. I started quite basic and progressed on to reading in detail most of the papers in later CVPRs.
    To my surprise they weren't difficult. Infact most were 
    quite straightforward.</p> 
<p> Somewhere around March I started implementing my own CNN and it took me a long time before I actually finished the theano tutorials and came to a place where I was
        ready to write serious codes. I just finished my implementation. I was able to test it out on a lot of datasets and produce such nice activations as
        these on the MNIST noisy background dataset </p>



<p> It is a lot of effort to get into this field cold. I had to do that because I needed to improve my ideas on MIL by adding "deep" formulations so that 
    my papers generate some interest to the reviewers. But having started this, I now feel I might have a shot at some good ideas. Its easy to manipulate this
    and generate many complex structures to learn different things. I am hoping I will be able to now get my PhD moving again with these "deep" formulations
    to MIL that I am coming up with. I am also getting interested in deep learning theory. I think its quite understudied. While everyone's at awe with their 
    performance, its a handful such  as Geoffry Hinton, Jurgen Schmiduber or Leon Buttou who are actually doing investigative studies in Deep Learning.</p>
    
    
<p> I have made my codes available online at <a href = "http://ragavvenkatesan.github.io/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/">GitHub</a>.
Its farily sophisticated but I think it will do a lot of help to a starter. </p>

<p>While I am not qualified enough to critique the ‘art’ in these pictures, I feel that these efforts at publicizing deep learning are not scientific. They solve, at best, first world problems: Problems that no one should care about. As scientists in this field, I feel we should focus on better things. But getting out of the Freudian philosophical ranting, I feel that these are not even that good. Yilin blended Van Gough’s starry night with my personal photo, which in my opinion destroyed the beauty of Van Gough’s piece but also made my picture not that appealing with blue mouth and noisy jacket. Frankly it looks less like a portrait than like an old sun faded photograph. As a day to day consumer of Instagram, I wouldn’t definitely be interested in this as a filter.</p> 

<p>The deep dream, which also got a whole lot of publicity, including the front page article on time is also the same. 
<a href="https://github.com/samim23/DeepDreamAnim">This link</a> contains some examples of the now fanatical deep dream algorithm by google. Apart from the fanfare, its very perrier and definitely unappealing. It over draws eyes and animals. This makes most good beautiful natural pictures into creepy ones. If anything we should write an open letter to the deep learning community titled “ Deep Learning: Destroying good paintings and pictures since 2013”. I wish the deep dream community would stop doing such poor implementations, and more importantly, publicize them as if they are amazing art works while they are terrible. More importantly, deep learning is a system that seems to have an amazing capacity to learn and fit models for complicated data. We fully don’t understand it but understanding it could lead us to solve real world problems. These kind of projects are a criminal misuse of the resources, time and scientific thinking. But what do I know, I am just a simple PhD Student jumping into the deep learning bandwagon so that I can make my papers intersting.</p>
