                            <p>L&egrave; Kaapi Projekt is a musical collaboration between artists 
                               with diverse cultural and musical backgrounds that I co-started in 2014. 
                               The band fuses elements from Carnatic , Hindustani, Popular and Funk to create a 
                               wholesome and unique sound that takes the listener on a soulful journey. 
                               The name 'Kaapi' is derived from our love for 
                               the piping hot South Indian filter kaapi and the Carnatic Raagam. </p>

                             LKP was based in Tempe, USA and have been playing in venues across the Phoenix valley.
                             Recently, as I moved to Seattle, so did LKP with new members.
                             They are quite most known for their Rahman Medleys. </p>                             
                             
                             <p> Below you can find some of their performances and compositions. Hope you like them </p>
