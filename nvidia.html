                            <p>I am currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a>.
                               I work with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">Maxine</a> and 
                               <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">Broadcast</a>
                               products. For the algorithms and features in the products, I work on 
                               AI-based video-enhancement features such as webcam-denoising, artifact-reduction and,
                               generative AI-based image animation such as eye-contact and live-portrait models.</p>

                               <p>I also focus on bringing these models to production using NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) and NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs).
                                In doing so, I have also built and release AI Foundation models, complete with Model Card++.
                                NVCF endpoints are cloud-based inference endpoints that are supported by Triton Inference Servers.
                               </p>
                               
                               <p>I also focus on efficient enterprise-level ML platforms within NVIDIA, with a particular focus on
                               MLops for computer vision teams. I worked with multiple-teams and architected cross-cutting infrastructure tools
                               for data governance, management, visualization and preparation. I also built and migrated workloads for training
                               and benchmarking of various computer vision models including architecting systems for logging, visualization, KPI tracking,
                               continual training, hyper-parameter optimization artifact and configuration management etc.</p>

                               <p>For obvious reasons, some of the work that was performed while being employed by NVIDIA will not be made public here. 
                                Others that are already launched or made public are listed here.</p>
