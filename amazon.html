                            <p>I was employed as an Applied Scientist at Amazon <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa">Alexa AI</a>.
                               My focus was on efficient enterprise-level ML platforms that powered Alexaâ€™s model-training infrastructure, 
                               used by over 1500 scientists with hundreds of models trained everyday. I primarily focused on cost-efficient, 
                               and scalable distributed training environments. I worked both in engineering and research capacities. The problem 
                               spaces that I focused on were neural network compression via network architecture search and predictive 
                               early-stopping algorithms. Some of 
                               the work I have done in this team have been featured at EMNLP 2020.</p>

                                <p>Previously, I was an applied scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services </a> AI Labs. 
                                I was part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">AWS SageMaker</a> launch team and was 
                                involved in the development of several AWS Sagemaker CV algorithms, with primary ownership stake in Object 
                                Detection and Semantic Segmentation algorithms. I also was a member of the launch team of Sagemaker RL. 
                                I owned and launched model compression using RL that became a significant part of the Keynote address at 
                                re:Invent 2019. I also worked on domain-adaptation algorithms for Sagemaker CV, which lead to both products 
                                and publications including an oral paper at CVPR 2019.</p>

                                 <p>For obvious reasons, some of the work that was performed while being employed by Amazon will not be made public here. 
                                Others that are already launched or made public are listed here.</p>
