<p>I am a grad student. It is a given that I am a coffee addict. Every coffee addicts goes through the following phases:</p>
<ol>
    <li> The one who just rush to the nearest capuccinno machines </li>
    <li> The one that take the walk to the closest starbucks </li>
    <li> The one who have a Mr. Coffee in their tables </li>
    <li> The one who use an expensive keurig k-cup maker </li>
    <li> The one who uses a kettle, a french press and a grinder to grind their own coffee </li>
</ol>

<p>I just returned my Keurig coffee maker last night and today had made my coffee using the french press. It was the second best coffee I have ever had.</p> 

<p>Backing up a little, I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Brahmin">Madras Tam-Bram</a> iyengar from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplicane">Triplicane</a>. 
Being a coffee addict for some from my background is the equivalent of saying all humans are water addicts. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee">Filter Kaapi</a>
is just a way of life. Its just one those things that you do: drink kaapi while reading <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/">The Hindu</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprabhatam">Suprabhatam</a>
playing in the background. Its one of those things that I didn't think about much until I moved to the US when I realized how much of an impact coffee has on me. I was poor when I moved here first, so I had to 
stick to circle K's brews or McDonald's coffee. While being good, they don't come anywhere close to kaapi.</p>

<p>I then discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew">Drip brewers</a> and experimented with various different coffee makers. While all this was Ok, it still didn't come
anywhere close to kaapi. I moved on from kaapi soon though, partly due to the fact that once I started my PhD, I really didn't have much time to dwell over coffee. The fastest coffee maker
is usually good. I also moved from brewing my own evening coffee to getting my evening brew from starbucks.</p>

<p>After 5 years of this, I bought the <a href="http://www.keurig.com/K250">keurig 2.0</a>. The keurig was an impressive machine on display. It looks serene. Makes coffee almost instantaneously.
I bought it along with a multitude of different varities of coffees to go along with it. While everyone who I served coffee to like it, I couldn't come to enjoy it. The coffee was weak, less in 
quantity, not nearly hot enough nor tasty enough. When you brew coffee at home, you'd expect the entire house to smell of coffee, in keurig, I had to put my nose into the cup to get the smell.</p>

<p> I was reading online and discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press">The French Press</a>. Frankly I am embarrassed that I haven't used the french press until now. 
I quickly bought a grinder, went to the nearest farmer's market and picked out an assortment of coffee beans, had them roasted and brought home with a brand new french pres from Mr.Coffee. 
Today morning I just made my second batch, and its the best coffee I have had next to kaapi.</p>
