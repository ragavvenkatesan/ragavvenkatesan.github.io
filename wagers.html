                            a lunch meal of the winner's choosing that a peer-reviewed article
                            will be published by the end of the year 2024, that demonstrates the use of data,
                            generated from a <i>teacher</i> network conditioned on the logits created in a fashion
                            similar to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09412.pdf">mix-up</a>
                            for augmenting the dataset during the training of a <i>student</i> network.
                            </p>
                            <p>The supposition here is that if in mix-up the authors were able to mix labels and 
                                <i>interpolate</i> data and treat this new combination of label-data as supervision,
                            then it must also be possible to use a discriminator to create a logit and <i>generate</i>
                            an image, use this logit-data pair as supervision to augment a supervised dataset.</p>
